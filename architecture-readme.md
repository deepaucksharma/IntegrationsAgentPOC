## System Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the Workflow Agent system:


*Key Components (with links to source code directories):*

*   **User Interface (CLI/API)**:  The entry point for users to interact with the system, primarily through the command-line interface defined in [`src/workflow_agent/main.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/main.py).
*   **Workflow Agent (Main Controller)**:  The core of the system, responsible for orchestrating workflows.  Also found in [`src/workflow_agent/main.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/main.py).
*   **Multi-Agent System**:  A collection of specialized agents that handle different aspects of the workflow, such as knowledge retrieval, script generation, and execution. Located in [`src/workflow_agent/multi_agent`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/multi_agent).
*   **Integration Registry**:  A plugin system that allows for dynamic loading and management of different integrations.  See [`src/workflow_agent/integrations/registry.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/integrations/registry.py) and the `integrations` directory.
*   **Configuration Management**:  Handles loading, validation, and management of system configurations. See the `config` directory: [`src/workflow_agent/config`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/config).
*   **Dependency Container**:  Manages the dependencies between different components, ensuring proper initialization and lifecycle management.  See [`src/workflow_agent/core/container.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/core/container.py).
*   **Script Generator & Validator**:  Responsible for generating and validating scripts based on templates and documentation. Located in [`src/workflow_agent/scripting`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/scripting).
*   **Documentation Parser**:  Extracts structured information from integration documentation. See [`src/workflow_agent/documentation/parser.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/documentation/parser.py).
*   **Execution Engine**:  Executes generated scripts in a controlled environment, with options for isolation. Found in [`src/workflow_agent/execution`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/execution).
*   **Recovery Manager (Rollback)**:  Handles error recovery and rollback operations. Located in [`src/workflow_agent/rollback`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/rollback) and [`src/workflow_agent/recovery`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/recovery).
*   **Knowledge Base & Manager**:  Stores and manages knowledge extracted from documentation and previous executions. See [`src/workflow_agent/knowledge`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/knowledge) and [`src/workflow_agent/storage/knowledge_base.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/storage/knowledge_base.py).
*   **Storage & History**:  Manages persistent storage for execution history and other data.  Located in [`src/workflow_agent/storage`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/storage).

## Core Design Principles

The architecture is built upon the following key principles:

### 1. Separation of Concerns

Each component has a clearly defined responsibility, promoting modularity and maintainability. This is reflected throughout the codebase, with separate directories for major functionalities (e.g., `core`, `config`, `multi_agent`, `integrations`, etc.).

### 2. Message-Driven Architecture

Components communicate asynchronously using a message bus ([`src/workflow_agent/core/message_bus.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/core/message_bus.py)). This decouples components, allowing them to operate independently and improving overall system resilience.

### 3. Immutable State Management

The `WorkflowState` object ([`src/workflow_agent/core/state.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/core/state.py)) is designed to be immutable.  State transitions create new instances, providing a clear audit trail and enabling safe concurrent operations.

### 4. Dynamic Discovery

Integrations are discovered and loaded dynamically at runtime, allowing for easy extension without modifying core code.  See the `IntegrationRegistry` ([`src/workflow_agent/integrations/registry.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/integrations/registry.py)) and the `IntegrationManager` ([`src/workflow_agent/integrations/manager.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/integrations/manager.py)).

## Technical Stack

The Workflow Agent is built using the following technologies:

-   **Python 3.8+**: The core programming language.
-   **Pydantic**: Used for data validation, settings management, and defining the structure of the `WorkflowState` and configuration. ([`src/workflow_agent/config/configuration.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/config/configuration.py), [`src/workflow_agent/core/state.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/core/state.py))
-   **AsyncIO**:  Provides the asynchronous programming framework, enabling concurrent execution of tasks.
-   **Jinja2**:  A templating engine used for dynamic script generation. ([`src/workflow_agent/scripting/generator.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/scripting/generator.py), [`src/workflow_agent/config/templates.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/config/templates.py))
-   **SQLite**: Used for local data persistence (execution history, knowledge base). ([`src/workflow_agent/storage`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/storage))
-   **Docker**:  Provides an optional isolation mechanism for script execution. ([`src/workflow_agent/execution/isolation.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/execution/isolation.py))
-   **aiohttp**: Used for asynchronous HTTP requests, particularly in documentation fetching. ([`src/workflow_agent/documentation/parser.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/documentation/parser.py))

Dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt` ([`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/requirements.txt)).

## System Boundaries

The Workflow Agent interacts with several external systems:


-   **User/Admin (CLI/API)**:  Users interact with the system through a command-line interface or API.
-   **Workflow Agent Framework**:  The core system, as described in this document.
-   **Target System (for execution)**:  The system on which the generated scripts are executed (e.g., a server, a virtual machine, a container).
-   **External Systems**:
    -   **Documentation Sites**:  Sources of information for dynamic script generation.
    -   **Package Managers**:  Used for installing and managing software on target systems (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `choco`).
    -   **Target Systems**:  The systems where the integrations are installed, verified, or removed.

## Key Interfaces

The system exposes several key interfaces:

1.  **CLI/API Interface**:  The primary way for users to interact with the system, defined in [`src/workflow_agent/main.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/main.py).
2.  **Integration Interface**:  A standardized interface (`IntegrationBase` in [`src/workflow_agent/integrations/base.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/integrations/base.py)) for adding new integrations to the system.
3.  **Documentation Interface**:  An interface for fetching documentation from external sources, implemented in the `DocumentationParser` ([`src/workflow_agent/documentation/parser.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/documentation/parser.py)).
4.  **Execution Interface**:  An abstraction for executing scripts in different environments (direct, Docker, etc.), provided by the `ScriptExecutor` ([`src/workflow_agent/execution/executor.py`](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/src/workflow_agent/execution/executor.py)) and related modules.
