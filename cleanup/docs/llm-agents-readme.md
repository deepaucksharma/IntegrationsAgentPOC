## Enhanced Agent Responsibilities

### 1. Coordinator Agent with Recovery Management

Acts as the central orchestrator for the entire workflow with enhanced error handling and recovery:

-   Manages workflow lifecycle with checkpointing
-   Creates and maintains workflow plans with verification
-   Schedules agent activities in the correct sequence
-   Handles the overall success/failure of workflow execution
-   Implements retry and recovery logic for resilience
-   Maintains immutable state throughout the workflow

## Enhanced AI-Driven Components

The framework incorporates several enhanced AI-driven components:

### 1. Enhanced Documentation Parser

Uses NLP techniques to extract structured information from documentation with security awareness:

```

```
+----------------+     +------------------+     +----------------+
|                |     |                  |     |                |
| Execution      |---->| Root Cause       |---->| Script         |
| Failure        |     | Analysis         |---->| Improvements   |

## Enhanced Message-Based Communication

Agents communicate through an enhanced message bus using a publish-subscribe pattern with improved reliability:

```
+-----------------+                       +-------------------+
|                 |     publish           |                   |
| Source Agent    +---------------------->+ Enhanced Message  |
|                 |     (topic, payload)  | Bus with Delivery |
+-----------------+                       | Confirmation      |
                                          +--------+----------+
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                   |
+-------------------+                    +---------v----------+
|                   |     callback       |                    |
| Subscriber Agent  +<-------------------+ Message            |

| Handling          |                    | Retry Logic        |
+-------------------+                    +--------------------+
```

## Enhanced Recovery System Integration

The multi-agent system now integrates with the enhanced recovery system:

```
+-------------------+     +-----------------+     +-------------------+

                                |                          |
                                v                          v
                    +------------+---------+     +---------+---------+
                    |                      |     |                   |
                    | Full Rollback        |     | Staged Rollback   |
                    | Strategy             |     | Strategy          |
                    |                      |     |                   |
                    +----------------------+     +-------------------+
                                                          |
                                                          v
                                                 +---------+---------+
                                                 |                   |
