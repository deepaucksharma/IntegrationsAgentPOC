# IntegrationsAgentPOC Refactoring

## Overview

The IntegrationsAgentPOC codebase has been refactored to fix a number of issues and implement the missing functionality for script generation. The refactoring focused on:

1. Completing the script generation system with template-based and LLM-based capabilities
2. Implementing the enhancement system for scripts
3. Making the code more robust with proper error handling
4. Adding support for template fallbacks

## Key Components Fixed

### ScriptGenerator

The `ScriptGenerator` class was completely rewritten to:

- Properly handle template loading and rendering
- Provide robust error handling
- Implement fallback to default templates
- Save generated scripts to files

### LLMScriptGenerator

The `LLMScriptGenerator` class was fixed to:

- Properly initialize the LLM client (supporting both Gemini and OpenAI)
- Generate scripts using LLM with appropriate prompts
- Fall back to template-based generation if LLM is not available
- Handle various error conditions

### EnhancedScriptGenerator

The `EnhancedScriptGenerator` class was implemented to:

- Enhance existing scripts with LLM-based improvements
- Provide a hybrid approach combining templates and LLM capabilities
- Save enhanced scripts to files

### Mock Implementations

Mock implementations were added to:

- Allow the system to work even without an LLM API key
- Generate reasonable scripts for testing purposes
- Provide a consistent interface for all script generation methods

## Templates

The following templates were created:

- Install templates for both PowerShell and Bash
- Verify templates for both PowerShell and Bash
- Uninstall templates for both PowerShell and Bash

## Testing

Multiple test scripts were created to verify the functionality:

- `test_refactored.py`: Tests the basic script generation functionality
- `test_workflow_with_llm.py`: Tests the full workflow with all script generation methods

## How to Run

```shell
# Set your PYTHONPATH to include the project directory
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Path\To\IntegrationsAgentPOC

# Run the basic test
python test_refactored.py

# Run the full workflow test
python test_workflow_with_llm.py
```

## Configuration

To use the real LLM-based generation (instead of mock):

1. Set your API key as an environment variable:

```shell
# For Gemini
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For OpenAI
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Or update the `workflow_config.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Gemini configuration
llm_provider: "gemini"
gemini_api_key: "your_api_key_here"

# Or OpenAI configuration
llm_provider: "openai"
openai_api_key: "your_api_key_here"
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add more robust test cases with different parameters
2. Implement integration with actual Gemini and OpenAI APIs
3. Add more specialized templates for different integration types
4. Improve error handling and logging
5. Implement caching for LLM responses to reduce API costs
