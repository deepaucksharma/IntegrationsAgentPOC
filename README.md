![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/add4a13a-f250-4c5a-a1cd-e4f561b285ed)


A Python framework for orchestrating multi-step workflows with AI-driven adaptation and self-improvement capabilities, featuring dynamic documentation-based integration.

## Introduction

Workflow Agent is designed to simplify and automate the process of integrating infrastructure agents, monitoring tools, and other services across diverse environments. By combining a multi-agent architecture with dynamic documentation parsing, the framework can adapt to various platforms and generate optimal installation strategies automatically.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Adaptation**: Dynamically analyzes documentation to generate optimal installation scripts
- **Self-Improvement**: Learns from failures and improves future execution strategies
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents coordinate for comprehensive workflow management
- **Platform Awareness**: Detects and adapts to different operating systems and package managers
- **Robust Error Handling**: Built-in recovery and rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
- **Isolation Options**: Support for both direct and containerized (Docker) execution for security

## Documentation Contents

This documentation is structured across several focused README files:

1.  **[Architecture Overview](architecture-readme.md)**: System architecture, component relationships, and design patterns
2.  **[LLM & Agent System](llm-agents-readme.md)**: The multi-agent system and AI-driven components
3.  **[Component Hierarchy](component-hierarchy-readme.md)**: Detailed breakdown of system modules and their responsibilities
4.  **[Data Flow](data-flow-readme.md)**: Information flow throughout the workflow lifecycle
5.  **[Developer Setup & Troubleshooting](developer-readme.md)**: Setup instructions, common issues, and debugging tips

## Workflow Example

The following demonstrates a typical workflow for installing a monitoring agent:

```
+----------------+    +-------------------+    +--------------------+
| Initial Request |--->| Knowledge Retrieval |--->| Strategy Selection |
+----------------+    +-------------------+    +--------------------+
                                                          |
+----------------+    +------------------+    +------------v--------+
| Verification    |<---| Script Execution |<---| Script Generation  |
+----------------+    +------------------+    +-------------------+
        |
        v
+----------------+
| Success/Failure |
+----------------+
```

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have:

-   **Python 3.8 or higher**
-   **pip and venv** (usually included with Python installation)
-   **Docker** (optional, for isolated execution)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/workflow-agent.git
cd workflow-agent

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package and dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run a test workflow
workflow-agent install infra_agent --license-key=test123 --host=localhost
```
